##Problem Statement addressed :
[Public transport is a challenge for every country. innefficient mobilty strategis in cities cause traffic jams and lost productivity. hybrid mobility routes using 2 or more transportation systems can be a solution but require a deep anaylisis and a clear view of the system.]

Citizens in every city now use data from smartphones navigation to work around traffic. Since current services on the market do not provide real time car congestion, its difficult to predict traffic flow, demand user flow, demography effect by region, weather conditions, planned or unplanned events, street size and roads, traffic lights optimization.

This difficulty leads to citizens using up to 2-4 hours of the day wasted on the traffic, leading to high stress, low productivity, high energy consumption, no income generator or incentives. 

##Description:

Nowadays, navigation systems or apps such as Google Maps have a great impact on routing decisions, and could therefore help  avoid congestion formation. However, such systems rely on projections into the future to assess the trafﬁc state at the time of driving, provide public transportation personal recommendations. but could even  estimate savings or help cities create incentive  systems that nudge citizens to take alternatives and achieve a low vehicle usage with crypto payments or tokens.

It is important to recognize that urban areas vary significantly across socioeconomic and geographic characteristics that may influence the effect of public transit supply. The benefits of public transit are likely to be significantly higher in regions with high population density, extensive public transit networks/low motorization rates, and large low-income populations who cannot afford private vehicle.

Ridesharing services have become increasingly prevalent in many parts of the world. As travel demand and vehicle ownership increase in developing countries, encouraging ridesharing could potentially help combat severe air pollution and congestion. By increasing the flexibility of travel and providing a new travel mode, ridesharing could increase income and build a circular economy.

Tools Usage : With a wide range of data streams now available from a rapidly growing number of sensors & GPS devices, we can now understand the health of our road networks.. To make our cities safer and  more efficient, local governments need to apply Data Science provided in the current solution, going beyond the analysis of historical data, to predicting the probability of incidents by location. travel patterns, money incentives, safe and secure public transport, smart light  traffic and street signals, and impact on new road or building construction.


#Data: 

this model incorprates data from 3 main sources, public data available online, user submitted data and local goberment submitted data. the system will merge and relate the items and make them accessible for users.

##Reflections 

this was our first experience workng with tiger graph and graph databases in general, it was a step learning curve, but a fun project undoubtly. In retrospective the capabilities that graphs can achieve are super critical in modern data analysis aplications, because real world data is always complex and the true value of data analysis are the inter relationships and patterns that emerge from the complete coneected data sets. 

certainly this was our first approach with tiger graph but it wont be the last, we are looking forward to incorporate this technology in future projects and continue developing our car kller aplication.

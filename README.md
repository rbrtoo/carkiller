##Problem Statement addressed :
[Public transport is a challenge for every country. innefficient mobilty strategis in cities cause traffic jams and lost productivity. hybrid mobility routes using 2 or more transportation systems can be a solution but require a deep anaylisis and a clear view of the system.]

Citizens in every city now use data from smartphones navigation to work around traffic. Since current services on the market do not provide real time car congestion, its difficult to predict traffic flow, demand user flow, demography effect by region, weather conditions, planned or unplanned events, street size and roads, traffic lights optimization.

This difficulty leads to citizens using up to 2-4 hours of the day wasted on the traffic, leading to high stress, low productivity, high energy consumption, no income generator or incentives. 

##Description:

Explain what your project is trying to accomplish and how you utilized graph technology to achieve those goals. Describe how your submission is relevant to the problem statement and why it is impactful to the world. Remember to link your submission video here.

Impactful in solving a real world problem Following the ODS Agenda 2030 Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. based on this our proposal goal is create a system that learns as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. It resolves ambiguity and tolerates unpredictability. It is engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time.

Innovative use case of graph This framework has many advantages for building multidimensional time series data: 1. The framework can maintain the original data representation in the form of a matrix. 2. The framework can reduce the amount of parameters in autoregressive model. in addition it provide data privacy protections and at the same time the algorithms understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as, syntax, time, location, appropriate regulation, user profile, process, task and goal.

Ambitious and complex graph With the financed resources being able to develop and deploy the higher technical, user friendly and advanced integrated platform that combines AI and TigerGraph tools to create a circular economy where every user is interacting, making transactions, updating data, processing payment. etc.

Applicable graph solution Nowadays, navigation systems or apps such as Google Maps have a great impact on routing decisions, and could therefore help to avoid congestion formation. However, such systems rely on projections into the future to assess the trafÔ¨Åc state at the time of driving, provide public transportation personal recommendations, estimate savings or incentive the low vehicle usage with crypto payments. It is important to recognize that urban areas vary significantly across socioeconomic and geographic characteristics that may influence the effect of public transit supply. The benefits of public transit are likely to be significantly higher in regions with high population density, extensive public transit networks/low moto

#Data: 

this model incorprates data from 3 main sources, public data available online, user submitted data and local goberment submitted data. the system will merge and relate the items and make them accessible for users. 



DATA ENTRIES PUBLIC DATA ANONYMIZED USER DATA GOVERNMENT DATA TOOLS GOOGLE MAP, OPEN STREET MAP. COPERNICUS DESCRIPTION: APP USAGE BY USER INPUT Shared data across systems and organizations available on platforms via API
